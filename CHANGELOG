# Changelog

## Unreleased
- (Reserved)

## 4.0.1
- Fix `RevisionChange` association setup to avoid duplicate `revisionId`/`RevisionId` columns when `enableRevisionChangeModel` is enabled with default attributes.
- Add regression coverage for default revision-change FK behavior and schema column guard checks.
- Add CI example smoke checks for `examples/v3` and `examples/v4` to catch install/start regressions earlier.

## 4.0.0
- Enforce Node.js `>=20` at runtime on `init()` with fail-fast behavior for unsupported runtimes.
- Formalize bridge-line support for Sequelize `^5 || ^6` with no feature expansion.
- Finalize v4 bridge documentation and migration guidance for `v3 -> v4`.
- Standardize release gates for v4 publishing: coverage, Sequelize v6 suite, and demo snapshot parity.

## 3.1.0
- Add a runtime warning when running on Node <20 (emitted once on `init()`).
- Allow opting out of the warning with `SUPPRESS_NODE_DEPRECATION=1`.
- Document the deprecation path: v3 warns now, and Node >=20 is required in the next major.
- Release policy + doc map, and release gates including coverage, `test:v6`, and demo snapshot parity.
