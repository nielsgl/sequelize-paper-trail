## Plan Gate Prompt

`PLAN GATE: Approve implementation for PRD-002 WI-006 exactly as scoped in this file? Reply: "Approve Plan Gate".`

## Tasks

- [ ] Export current alert inventory (critical/high/moderate/low) and classify by runtime vs dev/test/demo dependency path.
- [ ] Fix or mitigate all critical runtime vulnerabilities required for v4 release.
- [ ] Apply safe patch/minor dependency updates for high-priority alerts where feasible.
- [ ] Create explicit exception list for unresolved findings (reason, risk, target WI/version to fix).
- [ ] Update release checklist/policy references with security gate evidence requirement.

## Verification / Evidence

- [ ] Alert snapshot before and after remediation is captured (link or command output reference).
- [ ] `npm audit` (or equivalent tooling) evidence attached for runtime deps.
- [ ] Exception list documented with owner + follow-up target.
- [ ] `docs/STATUS.md` / this WI updated with final decision and evidence links.
